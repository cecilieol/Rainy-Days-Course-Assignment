# Rainy-Days-Course-Assignment

This is a cross-course project created at Noroff during my first year, covering the courses Design 1, HTML & CSS, and Interaction Design. We were first tasked to create the design, using style tiles and prototyping in Adobe XD, and then to create the design using pure HTML and CSS. For the Interaction Design course, I contucted thorough testing of the site using Hotjar, and improved the website's accessibility and UX considering the data I collected. During this course, I also implemented some JavaScript that I had been recently introduced to.
